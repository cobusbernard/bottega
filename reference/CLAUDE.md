# Bottega

Web-based UI for the Claude Code CLI: a desktop/mobile interface for managing
projects, tasks, conversations, and agentic coding workflows.

Start with @docs/project.md — a short index pointing to topical docs. Pull only
the sections you need rather than loading everything: `claude-sdk-integration.md`,
`conversation-management.md`, `agentic-loop.md`, `task-management.md`,
`authentication.md`, `api-reference.md`. Each lists its key files at the bottom.

> **Machine/operator-specific context** (your dev-box URLs, deploy layout,
> manual-test fixtures, auth tokens) does not belong in this file — it goes in
> `CLAUDE.local.md`, which is gitignored and loads automatically alongside this
> file. Copy `CLAUDE.local.md.example` to `CLAUDE.local.md` and fill it in for
> your environment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, CodeMirror
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, WebSocket (ws)
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3) at `server/database/bottega.db`

**TypeScript-only.** Every source file is `.ts`/`.tsx` — `tsconfig.json` sets
`allowJs: false` and a `pnpm guard-no-js` prelint hook fails CI on any new
`.js`/`.jsx` outside `node_modules`/`dist`/`coverage`. Don't add JavaScript
files; if you genuinely need to (e.g. a third-party script that ships as
`.js`), update the allowlist in `scripts/guard-no-js.ts`.

## Data Architecture

### What SQLite stores (server/database/bottega.db)

The database stores **metadata only** — projects, tasks, conversations, users:

- `projects` — id, name, repo_folder_path
- `tasks` — id, project_id, title, status, workflow flags
- `conversations` — id, task_id, claude_conversation_id, session_path
- `task_agent_runs` — id, task_id, agent_type, status, conversation_id

**Schema:** `server/database/init.sql`

### Where messages are stored

**Messages live in SQLite**, in two tables:
- `messages` — one row per SDK transcript entry, PK `(project_key, session_id, subpath, uuid)`
- `session_summaries` — incrementally-folded summaries per session

We register a custom `SqliteSessionStore` (`server/services/sqliteSessionStore.ts`)
with the Claude Agent SDK via the `sessionStore` option. The SDK calls our
`append/load/...` methods for every conversation; SQLite is the single source of
truth. The SDK still writes its own `.jsonl` files under `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for
its private resume path, but **runtime code never reads them** — the only file
that knows JSONL exists is `scripts/data-migrations/import-jsonl-to-sqlite.ts`.

**Query conversation metadata:**
```bash
sqlite3 server/database/bottega.db "SELECT id, task_id, claude_conversation_id, session_path FROM conversations WHERE id = <ID>;"
```

**Inspect messages for a conversation:**
```bash
# Via API
curl http://localhost:3001/api/conversations/<ID>/messages

# Or directly in SQLite — project_key = repo_folder_path (or session_path) with /. → -
sqlite3 server/database/bottega.db "SELECT seq, json_extract(entry_json,'$.type') AS type FROM messages WHERE session_id = (SELECT claude_conversation_id FROM conversations WHERE id = <ID>) ORDER BY seq"
```

### URL routing

URLs follow the pattern `/projects/:projectId/tasks/:taskId/chat/:conversationId`.
All IDs correspond to SQLite row IDs, so a URL like
`/projects/178/tasks/562/chat/2683` maps directly to row lookups:
```bash
sqlite3 server/database/bottega.db "SELECT * FROM conversations WHERE id = 2683;"
sqlite3 server/database/bottega.db "SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE id = 562;"
sqlite3 server/database/bottega.db "SELECT * FROM projects WHERE id = 178;"
```

## Third-Party APIs & Libraries

Before using any external API or library:
1. **Verify with Context7 MCP** — `resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`
2. **If insufficient**, use `WebFetch` on official docs
3. **Never assume** method names, parameters, or response formats

## API request validation

Every Express route handler that reads `req.body`, `req.params`, or `req.query`
must validate that input through a zod schema before touching it. Schemas live
next to their HTTP contracts in `shared/schemas/` (`auth.ts`, `admin.ts`,
`projects.ts`, `tasks.ts`, plus a `_common.ts` for shared shapes like
`IdParamsSchema`). Each schema also exports its inferred type via
`z.infer<typeof X>`, so backend handlers and frontend callers share a single
source of truth.

The boundary itself is three middleware factories in
`server/middleware/validate.ts`: `validateBody`, `validateParams`,
`validateQuery`. They run `schema.safeParse()` on the corresponding slice of
`req`, attach the parsed value to `req.validated.body/.params/.query`, and on
failure short-circuit with HTTP 400 and
`{ error: 'Validation failed', issues: ZodIssue[] }`. Handlers read fields off
`req.validated!.body as <BodyType>` (the field is `unknown` at the type level —
each route casts to the schema it asked for). When adding a new route, add a
schema to `shared/schemas/`, plug the matching `validate*` middleware in front
of the handler, and delete any ad-hoc shape checks that the schema now enforces.

## pnpm scripts

This project uses **pnpm** (pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json` and
provisioned by Corepack — run `corepack enable` once after cloning).

- `pnpm dev` — frontend + backend concurrently (Vite on :5173, API on :3001)
- `pnpm server` / `pnpm client` — backend / frontend only (used internally by `pnpm dev`)
- `pnpm test:run` — unit + integration tests (single run)
- **Production serve (this fork): single process.** No `pnpm build`/`pnpm start` script. `scripts/prod-start.sh` runs `vite build` then `tsx server/index.ts`; the Node server serves the built React app from `dist/` with an SPA fallback (no `vite preview`, no proxy — one process on PORT 3001).

Backend (`tsx`) does **not** hot-reload — restart the dev server to pick up
backend changes. Frontend changes hot-reload via Vite HMR.

## Verification gate — run before any change is "done"

**`scripts/gate.sh` is the single authoritative check.** Before considering ANY change
complete — and always before committing or pushing — run it from `reference/` and
confirm it exits 0:

```bash
bash scripts/gate.sh   # exit 0 = good to go; verify the EXIT CODE, not the output
```

It runs, in order: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` + `pnpm test:run` (this is exactly
what GitHub CI runs — if these pass, the PR's Unit Tests check passes), then `tsc
--noEmit` and `pnpm lint` (eslint — error-strict, warning-tolerant; its prelint hook also runs the no-JS guard) as stricter-than-CI local insurance. A green gate is the
definition of done here; do not report work complete on a red or un-run gate.

## Git workflow (this is an independent fork)

This repo is a fork. `origin` = **`cobusbernard/bottega`** (push here). `upstream` =
`vdaubry/bottega` (fetch-only; pull manually with `git fetch upstream && git merge
upstream/main`). Personalizations are **not** sent upstream.

**Always pin the repo and base when creating a PR** so it targets the fork, never
upstream (`gh pr create` on a fork defaults its base to the upstream parent — that is
the mistake to avoid):

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --repo cobusbernard/bottega --base main --head <branch> \
  --title "..." --body "..."
# merging is a human decision; hand over the command, do not auto-merge:
#   gh pr merge <n> --repo cobusbernard/bottega --squash --delete-branch
```

If you ever omit `--repo`/`--base`, STOP and re-create the PR — a PR opened against
`vdaubry/bottega` exposes fork changes upstream.

## Testing Instructions

- Always add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked.
- Fix any failing test until the whole suite is green.

```bash
pnpm test              # watch mode
pnpm test:run          # single run
pnpm test:coverage     # with coverage report
```

There is no Playwright e2e suite — UI flows are validated manually via the
Playwright MCP server and protected by the unit/integration suite (`pnpm test:run`).

## Manual Testing with Playwright MCP

Use the Playwright MCP server to validate UI work after implementing features.

**Authentication.** Two ways to authenticate as a real user:
1. **JWT** — `POST /api/auth/login` with `{ username, password }` returns a
   non-expiring JWT. Send it as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`, or as
   `?token=<jwt>` for `<video>` tags / WebSocket handshakes that can't set headers.
2. **Per-user API key** — generate from Settings → Account (plaintext shown once;
   only `sha256(key)` is stored). Send as `Authorization: Bearer ccui_<…>`. Every
   API caller has a real identity — there is no global shared key.

For MCP-driven UI testing, seed a token into localStorage before navigating, then
`browser_navigate` to `http://localhost:5173/` and the Dashboard loads
authenticated:
```js
// in mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate, once per session:
localStorage.setItem('auth-token', '<your JWT or API key>');
```

**App structure (4-screen flow):** Dashboard (project cards) → Board View
(Pending / In Progress / Completed Kanban) → Task Detail (docs + conversation
list) → Chat Interface.

**Don't mistake "Loading…" for an error.** The first `browser_snapshot` after
`browser_navigate` often shows `"Loading..."` plus WebSocket warnings — that's
normal startup while the app establishes its WebSocket and fetches data. Wait a
few seconds and snapshot again.

**Forcing a long-running conversation** (for mid-stream reload / streaming /
abort / reconnect tests), prompt: *"Run a bash loop from 1 to 60. At each
iteration, print the current number, then sleep 1 second. Use the Bash tool."* —
~60s of predictable streaming output that's trivial to inspect mid-turn.

| Playwright MCP command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `browser_navigate` | Go to a URL |
| `browser_snapshot` | Capture page state (returns element refs) |
| `browser_click` | Click an element by ref |
| `browser_type` | Type text into an input |
| `browser_press_key` | Press a keyboard key |
| `browser_wait_for` | Wait for text/time |
| `browser_console_messages` | Check for errors |
